# Lingo App Landing Page
As the name suggests this is a language learning app. This is just the landing pages with little to no functionalities add.

The app consists of three main pages.
1. The landing page
   This is a simple landing page with a hero image and a welcome text. It also has links to the courses page and the sign up page.
2. The courses page
   This page consists of course cards with various languages that are being offered. They have an image, name of the course, some details and a button that upon further functionality will open the course cards for more information.
3. The contact page
   This page consists of the address for contacting the home address of the lingo company. It also has a form at the bottom that can be used to pass on a message if need be. The form though at the moment is not fully functional.
